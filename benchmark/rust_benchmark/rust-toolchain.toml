 [toolchain]
 # Locked Rust toolchain for cross-language compatibility tests
 #
 # This is intentionally pinned so that:
 # - SSZ encoding/decoding behavior for Generalized XMSS stays stable
 # - Cargo.lock + these git revs for leansig / Plonky3 are reproducible
 #
 # If you need to update, bump this version *and* re-run the full
 # cross-language benchmark suite before merging.
