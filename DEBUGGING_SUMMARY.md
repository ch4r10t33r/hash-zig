# Poseidon2 Compatibility Debugging Summary

## Current Status
The Zig Poseidon2 implementation is producing different results than Plonky3's Rust implementation, despite:
- Using Montgomery form internally (like Plonky3's MontyField31)
- Using exact round constants from Plonky3
- Implementing the exact MDS matrix operations
- Implementing the exact internal layer operations

## Test Results

### Field Arithmetic Test (PASSING)
Zig and Rust produce identical results for:
- Addition: val2 + val3 + val4 = 1653695401 ✓
- S-box: sbox(1862878127) = 341767998 ✓
- Subtraction: part_sum - sbox_val = 1311927403 ✓
- V-operations match between implementations ✓

### Internal Layer Test (FAILING)
After applying the first internal round:
- **Zig output**: [1007135893, 1866050924, 554108004, 1117358287]
- **Rust output**: [1311927403, 1561259414, 249316494, 812566777]

### Full Poseidon2-16 Test (FAILING)
Input: [1, 2, 0, 0, ...]
- **Zig output**: [1210737510, 993482801, 1831516660, 90938561]
- **Rust output**: [1364841112, 1044563093, 1886792921, 2127407626]

## Key Observations

1. **Field arithmetic is correct** - Individual operations produce matching results
2. **Internal layer produces different results** - Despite using the same algorithm
3. **Montgomery form is working** - Values are correctly converted to/from Montgomery form

## Hypothesis

The issue may be that:
1. Round constants need to be in Montgomery form before being used
2. The diagonal vector V operations are not correctly implemented
3. There's a subtle difference in how the internal layer matrix multiplication is applied
4. The `one` constant is not correctly initialized in Montgomery form

## Next Steps

1. Verify that round constants are being applied in the correct form (Montgomery vs normal)
2. Check if the `one` constant is correctly initialized
3. Compare the exact intermediate values during the first external round
4. Verify the order of operations in the internal layer more carefully
5. Check if there are any implicit conversions happening in Plonky3 that we're missing
